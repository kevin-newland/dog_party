          <h2>How To Dog</h2>
          <p>This dog might just be the CEO of belly rubs and snacks.<br />
             With a smile that could charm even the toughest cats, <br />
             he’s clearly the life of the dog park. His hobbies include <br />
             perfecting the “puppy eyes” for extra treats and giving <br />
             motivational speeches to other dogs about chasing tails.<br /> 
             Rumor has it, he once caught his own tail and declared himself<br />
              a legend.</p>

          <h2>What Is Dogs</h2>
          <p>This dog is a certified snack thief, known for her stealthy<br />
             moves and irresistible charm. Rumor has it, she once barked at her<br />
             own reflection, thinking she found a rival, only to apologize with<br />
             tail wags. Her favorite pastime? Convincing humans that she hasn’t been<br />
             fed yet with those big, convincing eyes. She’s also the neighborhood’s<br />
              self-appointed squirrel ambassador, ensuring every squirrel <br />
              gets a good chase before they scurry away.</p>

          <h2>Facts From Dog</h2>
          <p>This dog is the self-proclaimed professor of “Barkingology,”<br />
             specializing in scaring off delivery drivers and rogue leaves.<br />
             He’s known for his perfectly styled bandana and his unshakable<br />
             belief that every sound requires immediate investigation. <br />
             Once, he convinced an entire park of dogs that rolling in mud was <br />
             the key to happiness—and then strutted home spotless. <br />
             His favorite fact? Squirrels are plotting world domination,<br />
              and it’s up to him to stop them.</p>
